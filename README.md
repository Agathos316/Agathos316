# Tim Mapperson – Personal Website

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains the source code for my personal website:  
🌐 **[https://agathos316.github.io/Agathos316/](https://agathos316.github.io/Agathos316/)**

I'm Tim Mapperson — a technologist, communicator, and coach. I work at the intersection of:

- **AI & Automation** – Building smart workflows using tools like Slack, Airtable, Zapier, and Make
- **Technical Content** – Writing for developer communities, from blogs to documentation to strategy
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts** – Developing dApps, trading bots, and Web3 integrations
- **Human Leadership** – Coaching, mentoring, and managing relationships with empathy and clarity

My mission is to build foundations on which individuals and communities can thrive — and to pass it on for generations to come.
